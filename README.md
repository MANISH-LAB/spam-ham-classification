# spam-ham-classification
 The observations of a labeled dataset are preprocessed using custom vectorizer to form a Bag of Words. Next a Naïve Bayes Classifier is trained on it.  The probabilistic classifier (based on Bayes theorem) with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features is used to predict the class of the unseen messages (SMS/Emails).
